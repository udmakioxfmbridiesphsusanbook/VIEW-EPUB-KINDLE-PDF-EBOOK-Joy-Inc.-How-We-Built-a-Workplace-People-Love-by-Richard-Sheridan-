Title: Everybody Deserves Joy, Inc. In Their Lives!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 1, 2018
Review: Joy is what happened when Richard Sheridan and his ‚ÄúMenlonians‚Äù experimented with their workplace. His story evokes a pure manifestation of the phrase, ‚Äústructure sets you free.‚Äù There is zero jargon ‚Äî the words ‚ÄúLean‚Äù and ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù are barely present ‚Äî just generous detail. This gifted storyteller invites you to enjoy his reimagining of Edison‚Äôs famous Menlo Park with candor and care. This is the story of a company with a mission to ‚Äúend human suffering in the world as it relates to technology.‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs Back Story
The book follows the author‚Äôs journey from ‚Äúyouthful joy to deep disillusionment to endless optimism.‚Äù Richard Sheridan got his first job as a computer programmer before he could drive. He knew at age thirteen that he was going to be designing software because it brought him joy. ‚ÄúI was excited both about my own future and the world‚Äôs; the computer was going to change everything, and software was the magic that made it all work.‚Äù Early in his career, his enthusiasm and talent brought him raises, promotions, stock options and the promise of great things to come.

I was excited both about my own future and the world‚Äôs; the computer was going to change everything, and software was the magic that made it all work.

Sheridan thought he had it made until he realized software developers were just cranking out buggy software and letting the public sort it out. Everything crashed. To keep up with customer promises, programmers worked nights, weekends and sacrificed holidays. The author resolved to either abandon his career or find another way to create software. Luckily he chose the latter.

After reading Extreme Programming by Kent Beck and watching a Nightline episode about IDEO, Sheridan had proof there was another way. He enticed his small band of software engineers to try a new way of programming by luring them with Java ‚Äî the new, hot programming language ‚Äî and promising the experiment would last only 5 days. The result was excitement, fun, pride, productivity and lots of learning. He never looked back.

The Myth of Introverts
When people think of programmers they imagine tech geniuses staring at their screens in insulated privacy. This is upended at Menlo. The company is one big room where everyone can see and hear each other. There are no cubicles. Most workplaces dedicate time and thought to things like: Who gets an office? Who gets the biggest office, who gets the corner office? And oh yeah, where should we put the new hires? With offices are generally based on seniority, one classic improvement effort is to fix the resulting layouts since colleagues are spread far and wide.

The Menlo offices lack cubicles and all the computers sit on tables. They can reconfigure the space on a dime and pull tables together when people are on the same project. Sometimes they rearrange the tables just to ‚Äúshake things up.‚Äù With programmers in a wide open space, ‚Äúthere was less I and a lot more we. Suddenly, when someone was in trouble or stuck, help arrived without even asking.‚Äù

With programmers in a wide open space, ‚Äúthere was less I and a lot more we. Suddenly, when someone was in trouble or stuck, help arrived without even asking.‚Äù

The results of the open space run counter to more traditional office setups. It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to call into meetings remotely even when they are a few feet away in a cubicle. Since 80% of communication is nonverbal, that lack of interaction has an immeasurable impact on company culture. Menlo, in contrast, doesn‚Äôt even allow earbuds. The human connection is sacred and part of creating ‚Äúflow.‚Äù They use a technique called ‚ÄúHigh-Speed Voice Technology‚Äù ‚Äî meaning they have actual conversations while looking at each other.

They use a technique called ‚ÄúHigh-Speed Voice Technology‚Äù ‚Äî meaning they have actual conversations while looking at each other.

Not only do they not mind the noise ‚Äî the sound of people working ‚Äî their culture fosters innovation. Their workspace is reminiscent of MIT‚Äôs Building 20 which was known as the ‚ÄúMagical Incubator.‚Äù It was home to laboratories involved in some of the most groundbreaking developments in science and technology because people were free to poke holes, knock down walls, talk to each other and shake things up. Menlo has created a similar learning environment and the faster teams learn, the more competitive they are.

Two by Two
One of the problems software development companies face is the creation of ‚ÄúTowers of Knowledge.‚Äù This happens when a lone employee masters a critical technology and the company can‚Äôt survive without them. Menlo solved this problem by having programmers work in pairs.

It took a second to understand that pairing not only meant people always work in teams of two ‚Äî it meant that two people shared one computer and only one of them accessed the keyboard at a time. It‚Äôs intensely counterintuitive and transformative. ‚ÄúPairing is one of the most potent managerial tools I have ever discovered because of all the traditional problems it helps solve.‚Äù

Pairing is one of the most potent managerial tools I have ever discovered because of all the traditional problems it helps solve.

Changing It Up
They change pairs every week. They swap partners on the same project, and they swap people between projects. This sounds disruptive and challenging for knowledge management, but just the opposite is true. This is one of the purest forms of what thought leader Peter Senge called ‚ÄúThe Learning Organization.‚Äù The result is a solid competitive advantage. It solved a host of problems:

Eliminates ‚Äúknowledge hoarding‚Äù and losing critical expertise due to turnover
Prevents people from being ‚Äústuck‚Äù with a team member they don‚Äôt feel compatible with
Prevents cliques from forming since there‚Äôs not enough time
Dispels misconceptions about others since you get to know everyone
Creates a safe space to test new technologies together
Office Meetings
If you get to tour the Menlo office, you might witness their daily standup meeting. At 10:00 am every morning the entire company stands in a circle to report what they‚Äôre working on and whether or not they need help. Due to their ‚ÄùHigh-Speed Voice Technology‚Äù this takes under 15 minutes even with over 75 people. Each software pair holds on to the two horns of a plastic Viking helmet as they address the group and then they pass it along.

Sandbagging and Rework
Most organizations struggle with forecasts and estimates. By definition they‚Äôre inaccurate. For a software development company they‚Äôre critical. Clients need to know how long it will take and how much it will cost. Since the programmers are closest to the work, they‚Äôre the best source of estimation. At Menlo, leadership commits to supporting their estimates ‚Äî they are trusted regardless of whether or not they‚Äôre right.

Consider what happens in less-evolved cultures. If programmers underestimate, there are late deliveries, cost overruns and unhappy clients. Fear of being blamed for mistakes leads to sandbagging. But if they overestimate, the client balks at the price. Neither of these is good for the customer, the business or the employee.

At Menlo, if the estimates are wrong, then they just relay that to the client. Either work moves up and gets done faster, or they agree it‚Äôs going to take longer and cost more ‚Äî end of story. Since programmers are not penalized for wrong estimates they take total control of setting and working toward aggressive milestones without fear of retribution. Clients get products faster as long as they‚Äôre okay with adjusting when the numbers are off.

Since programmers are not penalized for wrong estimates they take total control of setting and working toward aggressive milestones without fear of retribution.

Driving Fear out of the Culture
‚ÄúFear is one of the biggest killers of joy,‚Äù so one of Richard‚Äôs main responsibilities as leader is to drive out fear. He realized that if his employees felt safe to make mistakes then they‚Äôd be willing to take risks. In order to innovate and grow, his people have to feel free to try things out without waiting for permission. It seems to have worked since ‚Äúone of the most common phrases you‚Äôll hear at Menlo is ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs run the experiment.‚Äô‚Äù

He realized that if his employees felt safe to make mistakes then they‚Äôd be willing to take risks. In order to innovate and grow, his people have to feel free to try things out without waiting for permission.

Visual Workplace
In spite of the fact that technology is the product, the surroundings are dominated by paper, cardboard, thumb tacks and string. They conduct a ‚ÄúPlanning Game‚Äù on a big table where a sheet of paper represents one week of work. Customers and project managers map out what work will be done based on what literally ‚Äúfits‚Äù in each week.

Once the work is planned and agreed to, it goes on the Work Authorization Board. This wall displays the tasks due each day along with the pairs is responsible. Sticky dots represent status reports and a horizontal piece of string indicates the current day so observers can see whether or not they‚Äôre on track. No mystery about the work in progress.

They also have boards on the wall representing revenue, expenses and profits. One board represents the salary and position of each employee. Other walls are decorated with hand-crafted posters that say things like, ‚ÄúMake Mistakes Faster.‚Äù The visuals and transparency combat the fog and inaction that result from the more typical ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù reality of organizational information.

Who Works at Menlo?
For most organizations, the hiring process is a crapshoot. The main tool is the job interview but, quoting Richard Sheridan, that‚Äôs ‚Äútwo people in a room lying to each other for 2 hours.‚Äù The interview has never been a reliable way to find out if someone is a good fit. Menlo scrapped it completely.

They designed their own activity-based process focused entirely on cultural fit. Of course, programmers need to know how to program, but since it‚Äôs truly a learning organization, people can always pick up the skills they need. The result resembles ‚Äúhigh-speed dating‚Äù but with proctors and evaluations. They bring about 50 job candidates in as a group. They pair them up with each other and assign each pair a Menlo observer.

They designed their own activity-based process focused entirely on cultural fit. Of course, programmers need to know how to program, but since it‚Äôs truly a learning organization, people can always pick up the skills they need.

Pairs are given one pencil, one sheet of paper and a problem to solve while observers sit and watch what happens. Observers watch their assigned pairs while asking themselves a series of questions:

‚ÄúWould I like to pair with this person for a week?‚Äù
‚ÄúWould I feel supported if I were struggling?‚Äù
‚ÄúWould I be able to support them and would they listen if I did?‚Äù
‚ÄúWould I learn something from this person?‚Äù
‚ÄúWould they help me grow?‚Äù
They pair off the candidates 3 times, always with a new observer. After they leave, the observers discuss the group. This leads to a vote on who gets invited back for Round 2. It all hinges on whether the potential hiree would play well with others, share and be respectful. Do they have good ‚Äúkindergarten skills?‚Äù Beyond that they‚Äôre just looking for ‚Äúable learners with curiosity‚Äù since teaching them skills is the easy part.

High-Tech Anthropologists
Menlo works with their clients, but they also venture into the world to better understand the end users. They dedicate an entire role to this process called the ‚ÄúHigh-Tech Anthropologist.‚Äù This group watches people use and interact with software and prototypes. Their one one guideline ‚Äî ‚Äúobservation without interruption.‚Äù In one case they saw a user wearing rubber gloves while handling a prototype due to their proximity to toxins. The intended touch screen would not work with gloves. Without this discovery, the client would have paid for the development of useless software.

More Customer Interaction
In addition to spending time with end-users, Menlo hosts a weekly show-and-tell session with their client sponsors. In a reversal, it‚Äôs the customers who ‚Äúshow‚Äù the staff how they use the software. Programmers sit and watch as the clients demonstrate and ‚Äútell‚Äù them how it feels. Once again, ‚ÄúMenlonians‚Äù observe and learn.

Leadership
There is no discernable hierarchy at Menlo. They have no formal reporting relationships, but they encourage people to become leaders. They find that those who are ‚Äúgentle, empathetic, and trusting teachers‚Äù naturally grow into leaders. Another extension of this organic approach is that it‚Äôs up to the employees to award raises and promotions. Employees are judged by their peers.

Routine and Discipline
Beneath the organic leadership, the ‚Äúhigh-speed voice technology,‚Äù the viking helmet and the focus on joy, there are clearly defined, rigorous systems. What might seem like anarchy to some has a deceptively strong set of rules. The paired programming, the lack of walls, the weekly estimates and the Work Authorization Board are non-negotiable. And those who make it through their speed-date end up working harder than they ever have in their lives.

‚ÄúHumans are wired to work on things bigger than themselves, to be in community with one another. It‚Äôs why we join teams and companies, and work very hard and long to achieve a difficult and elusive shared goal.‚Äù

Learning From Menlo
This is an extraordinary culture to read about. Even for those not in the software development industry it‚Äôs instructive and aspirational. But, just as you cannot simply copy the Lean culture of Toyota, you cannot copy what Menlo has done. But ‚Äî you can get a lot of great ideas and experiment! The good news for everyone is that this masterful storyteller is writing another book titled, Chief Joy Officer: How Great Leaders Elevate Human Energy and Eliminate Fear. Watch for it on November 13, 2018.

Title: Do Not Read This Book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 22, 2014
Review: I repeat, "Do Not Read This Book!"

If you‚Äôre looking for something to read that challenges conventional thinking and has lessons you can apply at work, I‚Äôd recommend something from Dr. Seuss instead of Mr. Sheridan. Both authors are talented storytellers who don‚Äôt accept the status quo, but Dr. Seuss is the safer choice of the two. Trust me. I‚Äôm reading Dr. Seuss to my daughter at night and I enjoy the stories, the characters, and sharing the life lessons with her. I even get a bit worked up when I read books like "The Lorax", but I can go to sleep at night when we‚Äôre done reading. I mean, these are books for kids with quirky characters that aren‚Äôt real‚Äîthe last I heard, the Once-ler‚Äôs story of building a successful business that eventually failed was not a biography!

Don‚Äôt expect to fall asleep and forget the stories and the lessons told by Mr. Sheridan in "Joy, Inc"! So I'll warn you again: Don‚Äôt Read This Book!

Leaders, don‚Äôt read this book because it's likely that you‚Äôre success and ascension to power was achieved using traditional management approaches. Don‚Äôt bite the hand that‚Äôs fed you so well! If you‚Äôre just curious about the touchy feely idea of joy at work, I repeat, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Read This Book!‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a touchy feely book you can discredit because it‚Äôs all fluff or the characters aren't real. While the Once-ler was a fictitious character, Mr. Sheridan‚Äôs characters, including himself, are all real and Menlo Innovations is a highly successful software company! Not only is this book based on a real and successful organization, Mr. Sheridan openly shares his methods for building and sustaining success, such as pairing workers, daily standup meetings, extreme hiring, show & tell, high-speed voice technology, high-tech anthropology, personas, and story cards. Unfortunately, by the end of this book you‚Äôll see the business value of joy and know how to get started, so you'll be confronted with a difficult choice: Forget what you‚Äôve just learned and keep doing things the joyless way‚ÄîMr. Sheridan‚Äôs skillful storytelling and real world examples will make this a challenge; or, start leading the change toward a joyful culture. Read Dr. Seuss instead and you can sleep at night with no difficult choice to make.

For those of you lost in a joyless job, do not read this book! After reading it you might find yourself leading a grassroots effort to breakdown all of the barriers to joy at your work; or you might find yourself daydreaming about working at a place like Menlo. Both could result in termination and I‚Äôm sure you have at least one of the following: 1) a family; 2) debt; 3) a pet to care for; or 4) aspirations to move up the corporate ladder. Don‚Äôt let Mr. Sheridan awaken the optimist in you. Read Dr. Seuss instead and keep yourself from getting fired!

In fact, no one should read this book! Since Mr. Sheridan has ‚Äúturned traditional ideas about management and culture and sustainability on their head,‚Äù I‚Äôm afraid too many people will demand joy and even start to transform their organizations or even build new joyful organizations. I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôll experience a revolution of joy‚Ä¶and do we really want people fighting for joy!

Don‚Äôt read this book. Read Dr. Seuss and avoid a revolution of joy.
